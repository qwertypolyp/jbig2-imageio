Last fixes:

Version 1.4:
* IMPROVEMENT Issue 3: Reader recognizes if a file header is present or not.

Version 1.3 (Bugfix Release):
* FIX Untracked Issue: Fixed inverted color model for grayscale images.
* FIX Untracked Issue: Fixed IndexArrayOutOfBoundException in handling requests with region of interests. The region of interest is clipped at image boundary.

Version 1.2 (Bugfix Release):
* FIX Issue 1: The default read params will return a default image size of 1x1 without claiming the missing input.
* FIX Untracked Issue: A black pixel was represented by 1 and a white pixel by 0. For work with image masks the convention says, a black pixel is the minimum and the white pixel is maximum. This corresponds to an additive colorspace. We turned the representation of white and black pixels for conformity.
