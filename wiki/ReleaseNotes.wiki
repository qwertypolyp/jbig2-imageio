#summary Release notes of jbig2-imageio project.

===1.4===
Release date: not planned

Changes:

===1.3 (Bugfix Release)===
Release date: 2011-10-28

Changes:
  * FIX Untracked Issue: Fixed inverted color model for grayscale images.
  * FIX Untracked Issue: Fixed `IndexArrayOutOfBoundException` in handling requests with region of interests. The region of interest is clipped at image boundary.

----
===1.2===
Release date: 2011-10-06

Changes:
  * FIX Issue 1: The default read params will return a default image size of 1x1 without claiming the missing input.
  * FIX Untracked Issue: A black pixel was represented by 1 and a white pixel by 0. By convention, a black pixel should be the minimum (`0x0`) and the white pixel the maximum (`0xFF`). This corresponds to an additive color model. We turned the representation of white and black pixels for conformity.
